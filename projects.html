   <h2>Loved Pets Animal Rescue Website</h2>
   <p>This project introduced me to real world marketing and business skills. I was given a set of information regarding the clients
   Loved Pets Animal Shelter and I was requested to make a website to advertise their business. By doing this, I got to practice my HTML
   and CSS skills and even test out new things, such as the html scroll behavior. All in all, this website is a one paged website where 
   users located in Arizona can find pets available for adoption and even become a volunteer at this company. </p>
   <p>Want to see it closer?</p>

	<h2>Congressional App Challenge</h2>

<p>My team and I designed an app for the Congressional App Challenge tackling the idea of student aid or in other words, creating an accessible resource platform for high school
students in all subject levels, including AP Courses. To make our app and website more engaging and encouraging for users to practice and learn new things, we began to design and develop mini games that we can embed into our app. We also used playlab, 
to design an AI chatbot that assists students with whatever lesson they are learning, giving explanations and examples. It would also give them a practice problem to ensure they get it right.</p>

<h2>JQuery Lab/Mini Project</h2>
<p>In this lab/mini project, I practiced my skills that I learned using JQuery. JQuery is a javascript library that makes programming with javascript actions easier.
In this project, I was modifying a website for Habitats For Humanity and making it more interactive using JQuery actions. To make it more interactive, I added buttons that makes each section of the page slide up and down.
I also added audios and videos to make it more interesting.</p>
