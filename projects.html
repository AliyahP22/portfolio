   <h2>Loved Pets Animal Rescue Website</h2>
   <iframe src ="https://aliyahp22.github.io/LovedPets-/" width="1600" height="800" style="border: 0;" class = "scrollable-frame"></iframe>
   <p>This project introduced me to real world marketing and business skills. I was given a set of information regarding the clients
   Loved Pets Animal Shelter and I was requested to make a website to advertise their business. By doing this, I got to practice my HTML
   and CSS skills and even test out new things, such as the html scroll behavior. All in all, this website is a one paged website where 
   users located in Arizona can find pets available for adoption and even become a volunteer at this company. </p>

	<h2>Congressional App Challenge</h2>
	<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/jAnn1EY5M17ZFGrD5Dgmge/Congressional-app-challenge?node-id=192-56&starting-point-node-id=192%3A56&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>My team and I designed an app for the Congressional App Challenge tackling the idea of student aid or in other words, creating an accessible resource platform for high school
students in all subject levels, including AP Courses. To make our app and website more engaging and encouraging for users to practice and learn new things, we began to design and develop mini games that we can embed into our app. We also used playlab, 
to design an AI chatbot that assists students with whatever lesson they are learning, giving explanations and examples. It would also give them a practice problem to ensure they get it right.</p>
