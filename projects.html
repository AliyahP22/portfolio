   <p>This project introduced me to real world marketing and business skills. I was given a set of information regarding the clients
   Loved Pets Animal Shelter and I was requested to make a website to advertise their business. By doing this, I got to practice my HTML
   and CSS skills and even test out new things, such as the html scroll behavior. All in all, this website is a one paged website where 
   users located in Arizona can find pets available for adoption and even become a volunteer at this company. </p>
   <p>Want to see it closer?</p>
