<p>For my Check for Understandings, I have been doing work on a platform called Codepen, where I learn and practice my skills in HTML,
    CSS, and JQuery.</p>
   <h2>CFU 1: Showing and Hiding HTML Elements</h2>
    <a href ="https://codepen.io/AliyahP22/full/JoXwVgQ" target= "_blank">CFU 1</a>

   <p>This was my first time interacting with JQuery. In this CFU, I practiced the skills of showing and hiding an HTML element within my code
   . In more detail, I created buttons with different classes and IDS and used JQuery to program the buttons. If someone clicks show image, the image would show, or if they
   click toggle, it would show then hide. For CFU 2, I modified this assignment to add another button relating to a different topic.</p>

   <h2>CFU 3:JQuery Resources and Practices </h2>
   <a href = "https://codepen.io/AliyahP22/full/WbxeJpd" target= "_blank">CFU 3</a>

   <p>Similar to CFU 1-2, CFU 3 is a practice with all the skills I have learned from JQuery. I have also used a resource called W3Schools to learn
   more about JQuery and what can you do with JQuery. In this assignment, I used the .hide, .show .toggle, and I added a new button that when clicked, 
   it would show a new section called christmas images, and holiday images would be displayed.</p>

   <h2>CFU 4: JQuery Arguments</h2>
   <a href = "https://codepen.io/AliyahP22/full/emzOdMa" target= "_blank">CFU 4</a>
   <p>In this CFU, I practiced new skills that I learned to do with JQuery. The .css attribute and the .text attribute. The .css attribute
   is used to update certain css elements in your Jquery code rather than your style.css code. For example, you can update backgrounds. The .text attribute allows you to replace text. 
   In this CFU, I used buttons and based on the response, the background color and the text stated as an output would change.</p>

   <h2>CFU 5: JQuery Variables Practice</h2>
   <a href ="https://codepen.io/AliyahP22/full/LEZNbMo" target= "_blank">CFU 5</a>
   <p>In CFU 5, I demonstrated new skills that I learned on JQuery and skills that I have used in my junior year from a different coding language:
   python. In this assignment, using ids and classes, I created a college essentials list in which the user uses a input field that they can type items
   and add to the list. A key takeaway from this assignment is declaring variables on JQuery.</p>
