<h3>In my senior year, I was introduced to an interactive game design and development platform called Unity. Here, you can find some cfus and projects I've done.</h3>

<p>This was my first lab with unity. To learn the steps to create a game scene, I completed a few CFUS, learning different aspects of Unity. I
learned how to manuever through flythrough mode, how to use zip files and import libraries and assets into my scene, and most importantly, how to
design a scene and animate it with physics. In the link above, this is my mini game scene, called City Explorers. Using my knowledge based on the CFUS
I've done, City Explorers is a mini interactive scene where the user plays as a character and navigates the scene through keyboard controls or flythrough mode
There is also a hidden message in the scene for the user to find. </p>
