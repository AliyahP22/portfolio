	<p>This website was the website to my team project, FutureForge. FutureForge, made by teens for teens is an app that is designed to tackle the issues surrounding future uncertainty and navigating post-secondary plans. In our app,
	we provide accessible information to financial aid, skill building, career exploration, and midnfulness skills. This app although did not win, made it to the semi-finals of the InfyApp competition, in which I am very proud of.

	<h1>Congressional App Challenge</h1>
	<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/jAnn1EY5M17ZFGrD5Dgmge/Congressional-app-challenge?node-id=192-56&starting-point-node-id=192%3A56&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>My team and I designed an app for the Congressional App Challenge tackling the idea of student aid or in other words, creating an accessible resource platform for high school
students in all subject levels, including AP Courses. To make our app and website more engaging and encouraging for users to practice and learn new things, we began to design and develop mini games that we can embed into our app. We also used playlab, 
to design an AI chatbot that assists students with whatever lesson they are learning, giving explanations and examples. It would also give them a practice problem to ensure they get it right.</p>
