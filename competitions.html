	<p>This website was the website to my team project, FutureForge. FutureForge, made by teens for teens is an app that is designed to tackle the issues surrounding future uncertainty and navigating post-secondary plans. In our app,
	we provide accessible information to financial aid, skill building, career exploration, and midnfulness skills. This app although did not win, made it to the semi-finals of the InfyApp competition, in which I am very proud of.
