   <h2>Girls Who Code Summer Pathways Program</h2>

   <p>The Girls Who Code program/internship was one of my most significant experiences. During the summer of 2025, I participated in this internship to strengthen my coding skills and learn new coding techniques
   before my senior year. I participated in 3 fields of study: Web and App Development, Cybersecurity, and Intro to Data Science + AI. Each pathway gave me the opportunity to work with a group of students and advisors and conduct
   real world case studies to see how computer science has an impact. For each pathway completed, I have received certificates and am now an Alumni of Girls Who Code.</p>
 <p>Below are the links to some of my projects I have done!</p>

   <a href ="https://aliyahp22.github.io/Personality-Quiz-GWC/">Personality Quiz GWC</a>
   <p>I did this website for the HTML/CSS Pathway. I also incorporated javascript to make an interactive quiz to determine which disney princess are you.</p>

   <a href ="https://aliyahp22.github.io/Protect-Our-Planet-GWC/index.html">Take Action Website</a>
   <p>This was one of the final projects from the HTML and CSS pathways. Similar to the Infy App challenge, I found a issue that I 
   felt passion for and created a website encouraging others to take action and demonstrating ways they can play a part. I also embedded extra resources
   for users to learn more about the cause.</p>

   <h2>Queens District Attorney Student Advisory Council</h2>
   <p>In this internship, I travel to the Queens District Attorney's office once a month and meet with a fellow group of students and members
   of the Queens District Attorney and discuss issues that are happening within our community and how we can propose
   a solution. We also get the opportunity to meet with professionals in the law field and learn about various careers in the field of law.</p>
